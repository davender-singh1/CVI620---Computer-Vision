# CVI620 - Computer Vision


## Subject Description

As cameras are becoming a popular feature of standard PCs and mobile devices, it is important to be able to extract useful information from this data. This course covers simple computer vision concepts, 
such as capturing digital images and video, applying simple and arithmetic changes to images (e.g. crop, rotate, enhance color), and extracting information from images (e.g. finding or counting objects). 
Also, concepts such as tracking objects in a video sequence are introduced. Students will work on a project targeting a computer vision application such as face recognition, security systems, medical imaging, robotics, and others.


## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this subject the student will be able to:

Describe the hardware and imaging components to setup a computer vision system

Discuss image representation techniques and standards to read and write grayscale and color digital image files

Solve image arithmetic problems to apply image effects

Explain feature detection methods to detect basic recognizable entities such as edges, corners, and blobs

Compare matching methods for object recognition to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm

Assess the optical flow method to track moving objects

Implement a vision system to solve a recognition or tracking problem
